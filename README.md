# "Small group size does not impair reproduction and survival in social Damaraland mole-rats"

The files in this repository provide the R code necessary to replicate all of the analyses in the paper. All the data were collected from a population of mole-rats living around the Kuruman River Reserve, Northern Cape, South Africa.

The distribution of the Damaraland mole-rat in sub-Saharan Africa. The predicted current distribution is highlighted by the white dashed line [taken from IUCN, 30th June 2021], with the Kalahari Desert indicated by the shaded polygon. The location of the Kuruman River Reserve (KRR) is also highlighted, as are two other sites where medium to long-term capture-mark-recapture studies of Damaraland mole-rats have been carried out. 


The R scripts are separated according to analysis:

## i) Status-related survivorship in females

Using multi-state models to estimate 'survivorship' of females in one of three states: in-group non-breeder, dispersed single female, breeder. 

## ii) Early life growth, adult body mass

Modelling the effect of group size on skeletal (via teeth width) and body mass growth, as well as additional confirmatory analyses of adult mass.

## iII) The body condition of single females

Comparing the body condition of single females vs size-matched in-group non-breeders, through allometric scaling relationships of body mass on skeletal size. 

## iv) Within-group recruitment rates

Analysing the effect of group size on the recruitment rate of offspring across the duration of our study (longitudinal analysis). We also created new pairs experimental by introducing unrelated adult males to a portion of dispersed single females. Later in the script, we compare the rates of recruitment in these nascent pairs against that in established groups (experimental analysis). The idea of this latter step was to exiplicitly, test whether the absence of additional group members reduces the reproductive output of breeding females.
